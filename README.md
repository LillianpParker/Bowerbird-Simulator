# Bowerbird-Simulator
Enter the world of what is like to be a male Satin Bowerbird, attempting to win the attention and affection of some pretty lady friend across the way. Will you be able to mate this season, or have to give up until next year?
-------------------------------------------------

The entirety of Bowerbird Simulator was made with a variety of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. It is a button based game with many onclick functions throughout the entire app.js page. This game was done over majorly once in terms of design, and the code was written in major chunks that coincided with when the CSS was outputed (the CSS was a nice break from Javascript).

Access to the live page can be found here:

While there weren't any unsolved problems, future updates will include the ability to steal an item from the computer for your own Bower.

I appreciate any comments and critiques.
