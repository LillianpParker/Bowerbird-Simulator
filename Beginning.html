        <div id="Speech">Well hello! I'm Kami and I'm a Striped Legless Lizard! I'll be helping you get the season
            started.</div>

            <h1 id="One">You've found yourself in Australia, in the hot and humid rainforests of the eastern part of the continent, and its the time of the Bowerbirds and Teddy Bear Bees. But there's still a few things left
            to go over... Oh! Look at the precious new friend we have here. Let's give him a gentle boop on the
            snoot.</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="flex-container-2">

        <p id="Two">Hello Friend! Look at that fancy new body! Well, go ahead and give it a go! Give that tail a flick,
            that head a bob... Alright, enough messing around you're sure to make a lovely female happy, but looks wont
            get you too far, no you need to work in order to get her attention. And it'd appear, not too far from here,
            you have some competition, and, oh, there she is. Thats who you, and that other male are competing for. How
            will you compete? Well, thats simple, and is an incredible process. You will build what is called a Bower.
            And if that wonderful lady bird over there enjoys your Bower most, then ta-da, but if not, then it's either
            onto the next girl or you're out for the season. Now, let me explain...</p>
    </div>
    <div id="flex-container-3">
        <img id="supplies"
            src="https://images.vexels.com/media/users/3/160249/isolated/preview/14fab0425b54f10ea6f8e23265d4c620-feather-silhouette-by-vexels.png">
        <p id="Three">The Bower Building Season starts when you continue with the process, and every day you'll have the
            opportunity to go and scavenge for items to decorate your Bower with, however, you can only search once a
            day and bring back one item... Decorating is hard work ya know. Depending on the item you'll recieve points,
            now of course, the more rare the item, the more points you'll recieve, but you won't know what items are
            worth the most, see, females are a tricky bunch. Or you could spend the day checking out your competitors
            Bower and see how well they're doing compared to you, but traveling to his Bower will cost you two days of
            searching as you'll need to recover after. After 10 days, that pretty little thing over there will come take
            a gander at you and your competitors Bower and will determine whose Bower is better. Any questions?</p>
