<body>
    <p>You've found yourself in Australia, in the humid hot rainforests of the eastern part of the continent, and its the time of the Bowerbirds and Teddy Bear Bees.</p>
    <p>Wow, look at you, an incredibly handsome male Satin Bowerbird. You're sure to make a lovely female happy, but looks wont get you too far, no you need to work in order to get her attention.</p>
    <p>And it'd appear, not too far from here, you have some competition, and, oh, there she is. Thats who you, and that other male are competing for.</p>
    <p>How will you compete? Well, thats simple, and is an incredible process.</p>
    <p>You will build what is called a Bower. See? Aren't they fantastic! And if that wonderful lady bird over there enjoys your Bower most, then ta-da, but if not, then it's either onto the next girl or you're out for the season.</p>
    <p>Now, let me explain...</p>
    <p>The Bower Building Season starts when you begin, and every day you'll have the opportunity to go and scavenge for items to decorate your Bower with, however, you can only search once a day and bring back one item... Decorating is hard work ya know.</p>
    <p>Depending on the item you recieve points, now of course, the more rare the item, the more points you'll recieve.</p>
    <p>Or, if you're lazy you could sit around your Bower all day, but you wont get much if you do that.</p>
    <p>Or you could spend the day checking out your competitors Bower and see how well they're doing compared to you.</p>
    <p>After 10 days, that pretty little thing over there will come take a gander at you and your competitors Bowers and will determine whose Bower is better.</p>
